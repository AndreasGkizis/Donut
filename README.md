# Donut
I am not sorry

Completely stolen from this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/smcl/3828954) with a small addition to Thread.Sleep to account for faster CPUs
Thank you [Sean McLemon](https://gist.github.com/smcl)

This creates a spinning Donut in the terminal...
...also the code is shaped like a donut .....
